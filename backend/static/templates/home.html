        Git Leaderboard is a place where you can share your git projects' stats and see how they compare against others.

        Stats are submitted via the downloadable 
        <a href="https://github.com/TheAndruu/git-leaderboard" title="Git Leaderboard">commit checker</a> which sends them to the central leaderboard.
